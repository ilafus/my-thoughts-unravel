# my-thoughts-unravel
This project was born as the final output for a Master's Degree class about Foundations of Computational Media, with the aim to develop a coding project that would enhance our field of interest. 
I first started by mapping my midi controller to the p5.js sketch and then created the visuals based on the moodboard I previously prepared for the project. I wanted the environment to be 3D, so that the shapes could rotate on their axes and give a sense of dimensionality. The everchanging shapes and their positions should mimic both the concept of thoughts unravelling and the oniric sphere.
Then it was time to add the music. I finished mixing and mastering one of my old tracks and added it to the project. With the idea of making the interactivity more inclusive for the audience, I lastly worked on keyboard mapping and objects by dowloading the p5.play library for animations and further interactions.
I hope this project can become the base for future improvements in the midi controller category of creative coding in p5.js, while I wish more and more people will start to enjoy the web experience and listen to the track even on streaming platforms. 
As this project was born as a web experience to promote the music of an artist, I also plan to use this project not only as a model for future music promotions but as the starting point of a new genre of interactive music visualizers that could be deployed in live shows as well.
